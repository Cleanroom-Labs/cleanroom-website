## Introduction

[Air-gapped systems](/blog/why-air-gapping) exist for a reason — they're isolated from networks to protect sensitive data. But that isolation creates a challenge: how do you get data in and out? For most people, the answer is USB drives.

This creates a security tradeoff. The same physical media that lets you move data safely offline can also introduce risks. Understanding these risks helps you transfer data confidently.

## What You're Actually Worried About

USB threats fall into a few categories, ordered by how likely you are to encounter them:

### Malicious Files on the Drive

The most common risk. An infected source system writes malware to the drive alongside (or instead of) your intended files. When you open them on the air-gapped system, you've bridged the gap. [AirGap Transfer's](/blog/introducing-airgap-tools) hash verification helps here — if a file doesn't match its expected hash, something changed it. For background on how malware propagates via removable media, see [NIST SP 800-83](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-83/rev-1/final).

### BadUSB and HID Attacks

Some USB devices can be programmed to impersonate keyboards or other trusted device types. Plug in what looks like a flash drive, and it types commands at superhuman speed. This requires a malicious or compromised device, not just malicious files. The original [BadUSB research by Karsten Nohl and Jakob Lell](https://srlabs.de/bites/badusb/) demonstrated this class of attack.

### Firmware-Level Compromise

USB drive controllers have firmware that's largely invisible to your computer. Sophisticated attackers can modify this firmware to hide data, inject malware, or behave maliciously while appearing normal. This is rare — it's targeted attack territory, not something in commodity malware. Verifying firmware integrity is beyond what most users can do themselves.

If your threat model includes firmware-level attacks, consult a cybersecurity professional who can advise on hardware verification, trusted supply chains, or alternative transfer methods appropriate to your situation.

### DMA Attacks

Not relevant to standard USB drives, but worth knowing: Thunderbolt and USB4 devices can directly access system memory. Use IOMMU protections if your workflow involves these ports. See [Thunderclap research](https://thunderclap.io/) for details on DMA-based vulnerabilities.

## Choosing and Verifying Drives

No USB drive comes with a "verified secure" guarantee, but you can reduce risk:

- **Buy from reputable sources.** Purchase directly from manufacturers or authorized retailers. Avoid secondary marketplaces or suspiciously cheap deals. Supply chain interception is a real (if uncommon) attack.
- **Prefer simple over smart.** Basic drives have less firmware complexity than drives with fingerprint readers, hardware encryption chips, or wireless features. Less complexity means less attack surface. If you need encryption, software-based full-disk encryption on a simple drive is often preferable to proprietary hardware encryption you can't audit.
- **Consider write-once media for sensitive transfers.** For one-way transfers into an air-gapped system, optical media (DVD-R, BD-R) eliminates firmware concerns entirely. The drive can't be reprogrammed because the media is physically write-once.
- **Dedicated drives for sensitive workflows.** Don't use the same drive for air-gap transfers and general-purpose file sharing. Dedicate specific drives to specific workflows and label them clearly.

## What to Look for in a Drive

If you're selecting drives for security-sensitive workflows, consider:

- **Transparent supply chain.** Manufacturers that sell direct and have clear sourcing are preferable to white-label or no-name brands where origin is unclear.
- **No unnecessary features.** WiFi connectivity, companion apps, and cloud integration are attack surface you don't need. A drive that just stores data is ideal.
- **Metal casing.** Not a security feature per se, but physical durability matters when drives are handled frequently. It also makes tampering slightly more evident than flimsy plastic.
- **Standard USB mass storage protocol.** Avoid drives that require special drivers or software to function. If the OS doesn't recognize it as simple removable storage, something extra is running.
- **User-replaceable or verifiable components (if available).** Some security-focused drives allow firmware verification or use open hardware designs. These are niche but exist for high-security applications.

For most users, a basic drive from a well-known manufacturer, purchased through official channels, is sufficient. The goal is reducing variables, not achieving perfection.

## Practical Habits

- **Verify file integrity.** [AirGap Transfer](/blog/introducing-airgap-tools) generates and checks hashes for transferred files. Use this. If a hash doesn't match, don't trust the file — investigate why it changed.
- **Minimize the bridge.** Transfer only what you need. Every file crossing the air gap is a potential vector.
- **Keep the air-gapped system minimal.** Disable autorun. Don't open files you weren't expecting. Consider a read-only OS configuration where possible.
- **Have a plan for untrusted drives.** If someone hands you a USB drive, assume it's hostile until proven otherwise. Inspect it on a dedicated, isolated machine before it touches anything sensitive. Some organizations use write-blocking hardware for this.

## What AirGap Transfer Does

[AirGap Transfer](/blog/introducing-airgap-tools) verifies file integrity using cryptographic hashes, so you'll know if something was modified in transit. Future versions will add support for encrypted drives and additional protections against malicious files.

The goal is simple: make the transfer process auditable and trustworthy, so the [air gap stays meaningful](/blog/why-air-gapping).
